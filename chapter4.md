**CHAPTER 4: NO RETURN**

Priskin climbed onto the top of the building, tracing out the wire conduit on the side of the way that's leading up from the doorway terminal.

He opens the large electronics cabinet labeled ```InterDim-UPLINK``` on the building's roof, and after opening it, he is distraught by what the components inside the cabinet may be. Standard DIN rails with unknown equipment installed onto them on the front, and a big coiled module on the back that doesn't look like anything he had ever seen before, he knew this will not be an easy task.

He starts checking out the antenna array connected to the cabinet, drawing parallels to the antennas he was setting up in his original dimension. He figures out what he was tasked to do was actually to set up some kind of communication between dimensions, but that only scratches the surface of reality as he will soon discover.

He figures that the antenna's coaxial and trentunnial (CoTaK Industries' patented cabling scheme) cabling was deliberately shot with a bullet, and it probably has some connection to the scientist's deaths. He finds the required tools for crimping in the buildings Maintenance room, and reterminates the cable in the cabinet with a new connector.

The cabinet's different modules stop flashing the red colored LED labeled ERROR, and start slowly switching to a green colored STANDBY LED instead.

Priskin climbs down to check on the terminal, and the following appears:

```

Priskin wanted to read the unsent message first, so he started with that, knowing the command from his time as network technician at the company.
