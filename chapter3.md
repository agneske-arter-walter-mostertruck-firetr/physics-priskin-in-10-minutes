**CHAPTER 3: THE FORMATION OF A NEW WORLD**

After waking up, Priskin felt disoriented. At first he thought he hallucinated the place where he was, but it was everything but a halucination. After a few minutes, he started to approach a nearby industrial plant, it's big smoking chimneys could be seen from a distance.

While walking towards the building, he started to wonder where he could be. The strange buildings, the redish purple sky with multiple suns, and the blackening foliage with blue spots looked unfamiliar to him the more he looked at them. He reached the building and went inside. There were multiple dead scientists on the floor, with some being the ones who he first met on the conference about the quantum realm. There was a terminal on the wall at the main entrance, with the username AASTROWGER flashing, prompting for a non-embedded preauthentication keystone.

Priskin's heart is already beating so fast that it's a mystery how he can keep up without fainting, he races to the dead scientists to find the keystone. While checking the scientist's nametags, he finds the one called "Aaron Strowger: Lead Quantumspace Technician, CoTaK Enterprises", and yanks out the preauthentication keystone that's hanging from his neck. The keystone has the words "AASTROWGER LVL 5 ACCESS" grafted onto it.

Priskin installs the keystone into the side of the terminal's keyboard, and it goes straight into the internal network without any other login requirements, to the suprise of Priskin. Seems like this place wasn't meant to be found. The machine spits out the following on the amber CRT display it has:

Priskin is starting to question if he is breaking down or if this is a reality, but continues searching for an answer. It seems to real and cohesive to be an imagination of his, already lacking in creativity, mind. He is puzzled on why is CoTaK Enterprises, a small and unknown player in the telecommunications industry would have it's scientists in a different plane of existence, what 'mindcontrol-suite' could mean, and what happened here. He needs to repair the network to go further.
